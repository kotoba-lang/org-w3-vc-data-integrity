  "Verifying a corpus that contains more than one cryptosuite.

  `:suite` names exactly one, and a proof naming a different one is treated as
  malformed — it throws. That is right for a caller who knows what it expects, and
  it makes a MIXED corpus unverifiable: one unrecognised proof stops the batch. A
  mixed corpus is precisely what any change of cryptosuite produces, so without
  dispatch there is no way to migrate.

  `:accept-suites` fixes that, and is an ALLOWLIST rather than \"use whatever the
  proof names\". `cryptosuite` is a field of the proof, chosen by whoever produced
  the document. Selecting from it unconditionally would let an attacker pick the
  weakest suite a verifier supports — a downgrade with no forgery required. That
  attempt is tested below, not merely described."
