  "Pinned to W3C's own `eddsa-rdfc-2022` test vector — [vc-di-eddsa Appendix
   B.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/#representation-eddsa-rdfc-2022) —
   committed under `test/fixtures/` so the suite needs no network.

   This is the strongest validation in the whole `-rdfc-` stack, because the vector
   pins every intermediate value: the canonical document, its SHA-256, the canonical
   proof configuration, its SHA-256, the concatenated `hashData`, the raw signature
   bytes and the multibase `proofValue`. Reproducing the final `proofValue` alone
   would be weaker — a single number that happened to match could hide two errors
   that cancelled. Checking each stage says *where* a divergence is.

   It has already earned that: the vector caught a real bug in property-scoped
   context handling, and a test of mine in `org-w3-json-ld-api` that had asserted a
   wrong IRI and passed on it for want of a reference."
