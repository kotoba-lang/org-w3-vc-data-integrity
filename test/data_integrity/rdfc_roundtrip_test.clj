(ns data-integrity.rdfc-roundtrip-test
  "Proves `eddsa-rdfc-2022` is reachable through the PUBLIC api, not just correct
  in isolation.

  `data_integrity.eddsa-rdfc-test` pins the cryptosuite to W3C's vector, which
  establishes that the algorithm is right. It says nothing about whether anyone can
  *use* it: `core/issue` called `(:transform suite) doc proof` with two arguments,
  and this suite needs a third for its pinned `:contexts`. So the suite was correct
  and unreachable at the same time — a working component with no way in.

  That is the third time in this stack that a layer has been right on its own and
  unwired above it, so the round trip below goes through `issue-credential` and
  `verify-credential` exactly as an application would, rather than calling the
  suite's members directly."
