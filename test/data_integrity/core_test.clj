;;
;; This is the only test here that can catch a UNIFORMLY wrong implementation.
;; Everything else in this file is self-consistency: issue-then-verify passes
;; just as happily if the hash order, the canonicalization and the multibase
;; prefix are all wrong in the same direction on both sides. These fixed values
;; come from outside, so they cannot be wrong in the same direction as the code.
;;
;; Ed25519 (RFC 8032) is deterministic — no random nonce — so the exact
;; proofValue string is reproducible and is asserted byte for byte.
