  "The `eddsa-jcs-2022` cryptosuite of W3C vc-di-eddsa, algorithm for algorithm.

   Each public fn below names the specification section it implements, because
   the value of this namespace is that it is checkable against the spec rather
   than merely plausible. The one part worth reading twice is `hash-data`: the
   proof-configuration digest comes FIRST. Reversing it produces signatures that
   verify against nothing and fail in a way that looks like a key problem.
