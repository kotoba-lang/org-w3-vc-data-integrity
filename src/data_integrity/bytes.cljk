  "Portable byte-sequence helpers.

   Exists because the libraries this one composes disagree about what \"bytes\"
   means, and the disagreement is silent. `jcs.core/canonicalize-bytes` yields a
   byte-array on :clj and a Uint8Array on :cljs; `multiformats.core/sha256`
   yields a byte-array on :clj and a Uint8Array on :cljs;
   `multiformats.core/base58btc-decode` yields a byte-array on :clj but a VECTOR
   OF INTS on :cljs; and `ed25519.core/verify` wants the host's native byte type
   on both. Concatenating two SHA-256 digests and handing the result to a signer
   therefore needs one normal form, or the code works on one host and produces a
   wrong signature on the other.

   The normal form here is a Clojure vector of ints 0..255, converted to the
   host's native byte type only at the crypto boundary.")
