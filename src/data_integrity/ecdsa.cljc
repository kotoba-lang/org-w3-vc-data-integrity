(ns data-integrity.ecdsa
  "The `ecdsa-jcs-2019` cryptosuite of W3C vc-di-ecdsa, P-256.

  Exists because `eddsa-jcs-2022` is Ed25519 and a great deal of the world signs
  with ECDSA P-256 — including every WebAuthn credential, and therefore every
  `did:key:zDna…` subject this workspace's apps create. Without this, such a
  credential is not merely unsupported: it is REJECTED, which is
  indistinguishable to the holder from being forged.

  Structurally identical to `data-integrity.eddsa`: same JCS transformation, same
  `hashData` = SHA-256(canonicalProofConfig) ‖ SHA-256(transformedDocument) with
  the proof configuration FIRST (§3.3.4 step 3), same multibase `z` proofValue.
  Only the signature algorithm and the key encoding differ.

  ## The two things this gets right that are easy to get wrong

  **1. proofValue is IEEE P1363, not DER.** §3.3.1 requires the signature \"per
  section 7 of RFC 4754 (sometimes referred to as the IEEE P1363 format)\",
  \"exactly 64 bytes in size for a P-256 key\" — a bare `r ‖ s`. The JVM's
  ordinary `SHA256withECDSA` emits a DER SEQUENCE instead, which is variable
  length and would be accepted by nobody. This uses
  `SHA256withECDSAinP1363Format` so the raw form is produced directly rather than
  converted, because a DER→P1363 conversion is one more place to be subtly wrong.

  **2. A P-256 `did:key` carries a COMPRESSED point.** multicodec `0x1200` is
  followed by 33 bytes: a sign byte and x. Recovering y needs a square root mod
  p, which for P-256 is a single `modPow` because p ≡ 3 (mod 4). Getting the sign
  convention backwards yields a valid-looking key that verifies nothing.

  ## Signatures here are NOT reproducible

  §3 says ECDSA signatures SHOULD use the deterministic variant, but the JVM's
  provider is randomized, so signing the same document twice gives different
  bytes. The consequence for testing is concrete and unavoidable: unlike
  `eddsa-jcs-2022`, this suite CANNOT be pinned to a fixed `proofValue`. An
  external vector can only be VERIFIED. Every signing test here is therefore a
  round-trip, and the interop assertion is verification of a signature this code
  did not produce.

  ## JVM only, for now

  The primitives are `:clj`. `:cljs` raises rather than silently doing something
  else — Node can do P-256 but the key-import path differs enough that writing it
  blind would be guessing, and this namespace loads on both hosts so the cljs
  smoke test for the rest of the library still runs.
