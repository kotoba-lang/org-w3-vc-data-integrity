  "The `eddsa-rdfc-2022` cryptosuite — [VC-DI-EDDSA §3.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/).

   The sibling of `data-integrity.eddsa` (`eddsa-jcs-2022`). Everything after
   transformation is identical: same hashing order, same Ed25519 signature, same
   multibase `proofValue`. The single difference is what gets hashed.

   | | `eddsa-jcs-2022` | `eddsa-rdfc-2022` |
   |---|---|---|
   | transformation | RFC 8785 JCS over the JSON | JSON-LD expansion -> RDF -> RDFC-1.0 |
   | signs over | the document's *serialization* | the document's *graph* |

   ## Why the difference matters more than it looks

   JCS signs the JSON. Two documents that mean the same thing but spell it
   differently — a term written in full instead of compacted, keys in another order
   at a level JCS does not reach, an `@context` listing the same terms in a different
   sequence — produce different JCS bytes and so different signatures.

   RDFC signs the *graph*. Any JSON-LD that expands to the same dataset produces the
   same hash, so a credential survives re-serialization, re-compaction, and passing
   through a system that reorders things. That robustness is exactly why the
   canonicalization is expensive, and why it can refuse (see below).

   The cost is a much larger trusted computation: expansion, RDF conversion and
   canonicalization all sit between the document and the hash, and a defect in any
   of them changes what a signature covers. So this namespace is validated against
   **W3C's own test vector**, byte for byte, rather than against itself:

       canonical document      517744132ae165a5349155bef0bb0cf2258fff99dfe1dbd914b938d775a36017
       canonical proof config  bea7b7acfbad0126b135104024a5f1733e705108f42d59668b05c0c50004c6b0
       proofValue              z2YwC8z3ap7yx1nZYCg4L3j3ApHsF8kgPdSb5xoS1VR7vPG3F561B52hYnQF9iseabecm3ijx4K1FBTQsCZahKZme

   ## Contexts must be supplied, and a missing one is refused

   Transformation needs every `@context` the document names, and
   `org-w3-json-ld-api` never fetches — a fetched context lets its host change what
   a signature covers after signing. Pass them in `:contexts`; a missing one throws
   rather than being resolved from the network.

   This is a real operational obligation, not a formality: **an issuer and a verifier
   who pin different bytes for the same context URL will disagree about the graph**
   and the signature will fail to verify with no indication of why. Pin the same
   bytes on both sides.

   ## This transformation can refuse, and that is on purpose

   `eddsa-jcs-2022` always produces a hash: JCS cannot fail on a JSON document.
   This one can, in three ways worth expecting:

   - a `@context` was not supplied (`context-not-provided`);
   - the document uses a JSON-LD construct the processor refuses rather than
     silently mis-expanding (`unsupported`);
   - canonicalization exceeded its work limit on a blank-node structure
     (`:rdf-canon/work-limit-exceeded`).

   Every one of those is a refusal to sign something whose meaning is not pinned
   down, which is the correct outcome. Do not paper over them by falling back to
   `eddsa-jcs-2022`: the two suites sign different things, and switching on failure
   would mean the proof no longer says what its `cryptosuite` field claims."
