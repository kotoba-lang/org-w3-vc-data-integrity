  "W3C Data Integrity proofs over Verifiable Credentials and Presentations,
   using the `eddsa-jcs-2022` cryptosuite.

   `org-w3-vc` builds and shape-checks a credential but treats `proof` as an
   opaque pass-through field; this namespace is what actually puts a signature in
   it. Together they are a VC implementation; separately neither is.

     (require '[data-integrity.core :as di])

     (def secured
       (di/issue-credential
         {\"@context\" [\"https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2\"]
          \"type\" [\"VerifiableCredential\"]
          \"issuer\" \"did:key:z6Mk…\"
          \"credentialSubject\" {\"id\" \"did:example:1\"}}
         {:seed seed-bytes
          :verification-method \"did:key:z6Mk…#z6Mk…\"
          :created \"2026-07-30T00:00:00Z\"}))

     (di/verify-credential secured)   ;=> {:verified true :verification-method … }

   Two deliberate departures from the letter of the spec, both toward
   fail-closed, both documented at their call site:

     1. `verify` REQUIRES `:expected-proof-purpose`. The spec makes the check
        conditional (\"if expectedProofPurpose was given\"), which means the
        default behaviour of a spec-literal verifier is to accept a credential
        signed for `authentication` where `assertionMethod` was meant. Pass
        `:any` to opt back into the spec-literal behaviour.
     2. `verify-presentation` REQUIRES `:challenge`. A presentation proof with no
        challenge to bind it is replayable by anyone who observes it once.

                              a collection of suites — from which the suite named by
                              the proof is selected. A proof naming anything else is

   With neither option the default is `eddsa-jcs-2022`, unchanged — that default
   predates this dispatch and removing it would break every existing caller. A
   compatibility default is a different thing from letting a proof pick its own
   verifier.

   ## Why `:accept-suites` is an allowlist and not \"whatever the proof says\"

   `cryptosuite` is a field of the proof, so it is chosen by whoever produced the
   document — including an attacker. Selecting a suite from it unconditionally would
   let them pick the weakest one a verifier happens to support, which is a downgrade
   attack with no signature forgery required. So dispatch happens only against an
   explicit allowlist, and the empty allowlist accepts nothing.

   The allowlist also makes migration possible at all. `:suite` alone cannot verify a
   corpus containing more than one cryptosuite — a mixed corpus is exactly what any
   change of suite produces — because a mismatch throws rather than being skipped.

   `:suite-opts` applies to whichever suite is selected, so a rdfc suite still needs
   its pinned `:contexts`."
